#### Are you a copy-paste type of person?

Copy and paste this into your terminal:

`some code`

```
some other code
```

```python

# Comment following function out to use terminal-based user interface.
def graphical_user_interface():
    """
    Graphical user interface.

    Starts the graphical user interface.
    """

    root = Gui()
    root.create_set_of_inputs()
    root.create_calculator_button()
    root.create_close_button()
    root.window.mainloop()
```

```javascript

if (cartCTX.itemsInCart) {
        cartCTX.itemsInCart.forEach(item => {
            totalCount += parseInt(item.countincart);
        })
    } else {
        totalCount = 0;
    }
```

```js

if (cartCTX.itemsInCart) {
        cartCTX.itemsInCart.forEach(item => {
            totalCount += parseInt(item.countincart);
        })
    } else {
        totalCount = 0;
    }
```

Then come back and read the story, to understand why it did not work.

Next.js has two forms of pre-rendering: **Static Generation** and **Server-side Rendering**. The difference is in **when** it generates the HTML for a page.

- **Static Generation** is the pre-rendering method that generates the HTML at **build time**. The pre-rendered HTML is then _reused_ on each request.
- **Server-side Rendering** is the pre-rendering method that generates the HTML on **each request**.

Importantly, Next.js lets you **choose** which pre-rendering form to use for each page. You can create a "hybrid" Next.js app by using Static Generation for most pages and using Server-side Rendering for others.
